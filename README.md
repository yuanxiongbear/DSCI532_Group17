## About our project

### Motivation

There are 3.5 billions soccer fans worldwide which makes soccer the most popular sport in the world. Soccer fans may be supporting a particular player, club or country, or simply be interested in the top players and teams in the world. They may want to keep track of their favourite team, player or check a star board to choose the match they like to watch. Among those soccer lovers, there also exist many sports bettors who also need latest new and information to support their decisions.

### Solution

In order to help soccer fans and bettors, out team developed a dashboard app which shows the football star ranking.

![](img/dashboard_design.png)

The app contains a landing page that shows the top ten players, top ten soccer clubs and top ten countries based on the information that the users want to know. In the main dropdown list, users can choose to rank by player value, player wage, player ability and other options. Users can further filter their search by fixing countries, clubs, positions, and so on, or adjust the rank order ascending or descending. For example, by choosing 'value', and filter continent as 'europe', a user can learn the top ten most expensive players in Europe, top ten European clubs with the highest total player values, top ten Europe countries with the highest total player values.

For more detailed usage examples, please see our [proposal](https://github.com/mmyz88/DSCI532_Group17/blob/main/Proposal.md).
